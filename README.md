## Problems Faced

1. Difficulty in understanding the assignment instructions. Whether I had to use AWS Development Services or whether I am free to choose in how to build the CI/CD Pipeline.
2. Difficulty in deciding which service to use (CodeBuild or CodePipeline)
3. Faced Issue in creating the CI/CD Pipeline (As it was my first time using AWS CodeBuild). I had issues in uploading my artifact to the root of the S3 bucket.

### Additional Problems Faced
1. Wasn't able to decide on a design for the app.
2. Difficulty in using tailwindcss (As it was my first time using it).
